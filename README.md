# üßÆ Numerical Calculus Algorithms

This repository gathers a collection of algorithms developed for teaching and learning **Numerical Calculus**.  
Each script is written in **Python**, demonstrating the practical implementation of classical numerical methods used in engineering and applied mathematics courses.

## üìö Contents

The algorithms are organized by topic:

| Topics | 
|:------|
| **1. Zeros of Real Functions**
| **2. Linear Systems**
| **3. Curve Fitting**
| **4. Numerical Integration**
| **5. Numerical Solution of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)**

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Each file is self-contained and demonstrates a single method or concept.

To run a specific algorithm:

python file_name.py


Example:

python3 gauss_elimination.py


If the script includes graphical visualization (e.g., interpolation or integration), a window will open displaying the corresponding plot.

## üß† Educational Purpose

These codes were developed as part of the Numerical Calculus course at the Instituto Federal de Bras√≠lia (IFB) and are intended for educational and experimental use. They aim to promote understanding of algorithmic logic rather than computational optimization.

Each script is deliberately kept simple and commented, favoring readability and pedagogical clarity over efficiency.
